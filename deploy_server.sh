# polyumi-server runs BOTH halves of inference — the ROS client (policy_client_node, the camera, Foxglove)
# and the policy server (serve_policy.sh, the diffusion-policy fork in Docker) — plus training.
# So it gets the whole tree rather than a curated subset, and the three build steps that a plain
# rsync leaves stale.
#
# Companion to deploy.sh (the Pi) and fr3_session.sh's rsync of nuc/ (the NUC). Same idea: the
# remote runs THIS working copy, not whatever it last had. fr3_session.sh calls this; run it by
# hand when you only want to push code for a training run.

# rsync protects excluded paths from --delete, which is the only reason they survive this.

# silently drops a fork's own package directory (external/polyumi_vista_policy/vista/data/) and
# leaves the remote building against a tree missing files that exist here.
# external/ORB_SLAM3_PolyUMI is 2 GB of ingest-side C++ that nothing on polyumi-server runs.
# external/polyumi_vista_policy is hand-managed ON polyumi-server: the checkpoints under data/dp_outputs/
# were trained against a working copy that is not any commit of the fork, and overwriting it makes
# them unloadable. The dp fork under external/ DOES ship.

# An uninitialised submodule is an EMPTY directory here, and --delete would erase the remote's
# copy of it — silently, since rsync reports nothing for a directory it merely empties. Refuse
# rather than ship the deletion; `git submodule update --init <path>` is the fix.
