"""
FastAPI app for the catalog browser.

Serves the four-column Miller layout (Tasks → Scenes → Episodes → Datasets) plus a
detail panel over the synced catalog DB. Selecting a row issues an HTMX request that
swaps the column to its right and out-of-band-updates the detail panel (Phase 1,
read-only). Phase 2 adds task create/rename and scene→task assignment: these are
plain HTML form posts (no HTMX) that write the authoritative scene.json + DB row,
then redirect back to ``/`` for a full reload — simple and correct over
choreographing OOB swaps across every affected column. Phase 2.5 adds per-session
MCAP export + Foxglove launch; unlike Phase 2 these stay within the detail panel
(no other column is affected), so they're plain HTMX POSTs that re-swap
``#detail-body`` in place rather than reloading the whole page. Phase 3 adds the
dataset builder: building a dataset is a plain form POST + redirect (same pattern as
Phase 2, since it affects the Datasets column rather than wherever the form lives),
but *populating* that form is driven by an "Add to dataset" button in the scene
detail pane — a scene the user is looking at, not one selected from a picker in the
form itself. The set of scenes added so far (the "draft") has nowhere else to live
between requests, so it's kept as plain in-memory state on ``app.state`` — this is a
single-user, single-process, localhost tool (§2 non-goals), so process-global state
is fine and avoids adding cookies/sessions or client-side state for one working list.
It does not survive a server restart; that's an accepted trade-off, not an oversight.
Reads/writes of that list are still guarded by ``app.state.pending_dataset_lock`` — a
single-user tool can still see two nearly-simultaneous requests (e.g. two browser tabs),
and an unguarded check-then-append could otherwise add a duplicate entry.
Phase 4 adds a "run full pipeline" button on the scene detail pane: unlike every
prior mutation this can take minutes (SLAM in particular), so it can't run inline on
the request thread. It runs on a plain ``threading.Thread`` (started, not joined) with
per-scene status kept on ``app.state.pp_runs`` — same in-memory-on-app.state pattern as
the dataset draft, same trade-off (lost on restart). Progress is shown by the detail
pane polling itself via ``hx-trigger="every ...s"`` while a run is in flight, but the
authoritative progress log is still whatever's printed to the terminal running
``polyumi-catalog serve`` — the pipeline logs through the same ``logging`` root logger
that process already configures, so nothing extra was needed for that. Starting a run
is a check-then-set on that shared dict, so it's guarded by ``app.state.pp_runs_lock``
(a plain ``threading.Lock``) to keep two near-simultaneous POSTs (e.g. a fast double
click before the button disables) from both passing the "not already running" check
and starting two pipeline runs against the same scene.zarr concurrently. The pane
actually renders up to two buttons over that one route: "Run full pipeline" (the
original; ``force=false``, skips steps already marked complete — hidden once every
step is done, since it would then be a no-op) and "Re-run pipeline" (``force=true``,
re-runs every step from scratch regardless of completion — only shown once at least
one step is complete, i.e. there's actually something it would discard). Both post to
the same ``run-pp`` route with an ``hx-vals``-supplied ``force`` field; the route
itself is agnostic to which button fired it. A forced run clears the scene's recorded
step completion before starting (``pp_status.reset_pp_status``), so the pane drops to
0/N and re-ticks as the run proceeds instead of sitting at "complete" throughout.
Phase 5 adds marking an episode unusable (excluded from dataset exports): a plain HTMX POST
from the session detail pane, same in-place-swap style as MCAP export, except it also
out-of-band-updates the Episodes column (``_detail_with_episodes_oob``) so that column's
grey-out reflects the change immediately without requiring the scene to be reselected.
Phase 6 adds editable notes for both scenes and sessions: an HTMX form POST that re-swaps
``#detail-body`` in place, same style as every other detail-pane mutation. Session notes is
the first Session field the catalog itself writes back to metadata.json rather than only
ever reading (see the Session model + mutations module docstrings) — everything else there
still mirrors what the Pi recorded.
Phase 7 adds an editable task description, same in-place ``#detail-body`` swap as notes.
Unlike task rename (Phase 2), a description edit doesn't affect the Tasks column or any
other selection on the page, so it doesn't need the full-page reload rename uses — it's
scoped to the detail pane like every Phase 6 field, just with no on-disk manifest to write
(tasks have none; see the mutations module docstring).
Phase 8 adds a topbar "Fetch from Pi" button beside Rescan: ``pingest fetch``'s scene copy
(``PiFetch``, minus the CLI's confirm prompt and its GoPro-SD-card follow-up, which needs a
mounted card) on a background thread with progress in ``app.state.fetch``, polled by the
topbar status span — the Phase 4 pattern, one run at a time rather than one per scene. The
run ends with the same sync ``/rescan`` does, and the poll that observes completion carries
an out-of-band Tasks refresh so the fetched scenes are browsable without a second click.
Phase 9 adds scene deletion from the scene detail pane — the one destructive operation here,
so it's a plain form POST + redirect (Phase 2 style, since three columns change) gated behind
a native ``confirm()`` and refused outright while that scene's pipeline is running. The
disk/DB guards live in ``mutations.delete_scene``.
