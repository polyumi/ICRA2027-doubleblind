"""
Per-episode SLAM tracking-quality stats surfaced in the catalog UI (Phase 4).

The numbers come from the ``annotations/slam`` group attrs the SLAM preprocessing step
(``OrbSlam3Step``, ingest step 2) already writes into each episode's pzarr group — no new
computation, just plumbing an existing per-episode summary through to the catalog so
tracking coverage is visible without opening Foxglove.

This module is split in two, and the split matters:

* :func:`scene_slam_records` is the only thing here that touches disk. It runs at **sync**
  time, and ``sync.py`` mirrors what it returns onto the ``Session`` row. Rendering a
  column of scenes therefore opens no pzarr stores at all — doing that per render cost
  ~1 s for a 22-scene recordings tree, on every click in the Scenes column, and grew
  linearly with the corpus.
* :func:`quality_view` turns one session's cached metrics into the verdict and badges the
  UI shows, via ``polyumi_ingest.quality`` (thresholds in
  ``ingest/config/quality_thresholds.yaml``). This runs on **every read**, so editing a
  threshold still reclassifies every episode at once with no re-sync: only the raw
  measurements are cached, never the verdict. DP export calls the same policy functions,
  so this view and what actually exports agree.
