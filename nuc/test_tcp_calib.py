"""
Guard the two payload numbers tcp_calib computes rather than states.

Both fail invisibly. A mirrored yaw in the CoM conversion looks identical in the bringup log, the
service response and the robot's own inertia_load readback; a zero inertia tensor is accepted by
every layer of ROS and rejected only by the FR3 itself, as a bare "invalid argument".
