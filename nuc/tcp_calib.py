"""
The measured constants of what PolyUMI bolts to the FR3's flange: the TCP frame, and the payload.

The TCP frame is where the *policy* thinks the EEF is; the payload is what that assembly weighs.

The policy is trained on poses expressed at the closed-fingertip midpoint, in GoPro **optical**
axes (x right, y down, z forward). See ``T_gopro_to_fingertip`` in ingest/config/gripper_calib.yaml
and preproc step 5 (``eef_pose_step.py``), which retargets every exported pose onto that frame.
The stock ``fr3_hand_tcp`` is a different physical point in a different axis convention, so
observing or commanding it feeds the policy a frame it was never trained on.

``polyumi_tcp`` is that fingertip frame, as a fixed child of ``fr3_hand``. Two consumers need it
and they MUST agree, which is why the numbers live here and nowhere else:

  * TF, for the laptop's observation lookup (``policy_client_node``'s ``eef_frame``) and for
    seeing the frame in Foxglove — published by a static_transform_publisher in
    fr3_bringup.launch.py.
  * move_group's RobotModel — passed as xacro args into nuc/description/fr3_polyumi.urdf.xacro
    by fr3_move_group.launch.py, so its planning scene agrees with TF about where the policy's
    frame is.

Where the numbers come from
---------------------------
The rotation is exact, from geometry alone — no measurement, no ambiguity beyond one sign:

  * ``fr3_hand`` has z along the approach axis and moves its fingers along ±y
    (``franka_hand.xacro``: ``finger_joint1 axis="0 1 0"``).
  * the policy frame is optical, so its z is the camera's forward axis — which is the approach
    axis (``T_gripper_base_to_gopro`` maps gopro z to gripper-forward) — and its x is the
    finger-opening axis, since the tagged fingers open left-right in the camera image.

Sharing z and mapping x onto ±y leaves exactly Rz(±90°). The sign is which finger lands on
camera-left; flip ``TCP_RPY``'s yaw if the frame comes out mirrored in Foxglove (verification
step 4 in the plan catches this by eye, before anything moves).

The translation is a CAD read: the fingertip-midpoint origin — where the closed tips meet, on the
plane of the fingers' upper surface, coplanar with the ArUco tags — expressed in ``fr3_hand``.
This is the same method UMI uses; they hardcode their camera→TCP transform from CAD too
(``06_generate_dataset_plan.py``, ``franka_interpolation_controller.py``) and ship no calibration
procedure for it at all.

It cross-checks against the handheld gripper's chain to ~2 mm. ``T_gopro_to_fingertip`` puts the
fingertips 0.259 m forward of the GoPro; this file puts them 0.2569 m forward of ``fr3_hand``. The
two agreeing means the camera's sensor plane sits within a couple of mm of the ``fr3_hand`` plane —
consistent with the mount, and the sort of thing that would be off by centimetres if either
measurement were wrong.

**Verified on hardware, 2026-08-07** (``ros2 run polyumi_ros2 tcp_pivot_test``): pivoting about
this TCP holds the closed fingertips visibly still, so the geometry below — including the
``Rz(+90°)`` sign, which a mirrored version would expose as a ~15 cm sweep — is right.

Residual error, deliberately not chased: real GoPro mount tilt versus the CAD-nominal "optical
axis parallel to the approach axis". That is what a camera-based hand-eye calibration would buy.
Suspect it first if the policy is systematically off in *orientation* rather than position.

# The payload — everything past the flange, as libfranka's gravity compensation needs to know it.
#
# The FCI cancels gravity for the mass it knows about (m_ee + m_load) and nothing else. Whatever is
# unmodelled is a constant force the cartesian impedance spring has to fight, and it settles at

# MASS is the *residual*, not the whole assembly: Desk's end-effector config already supplies m_ee
# (the Franka Hand, 0.73 kg), so this covers only the GoPro, its mount and the PolyUMI fingers. If
# Desk's end effector is set to "None" it has to carry the hand too. Check which before touching

#
#     ros2 topic echo /franka_robot_state_broadcaster/robot_state --field inertia_ee --once
#
# Note franka_hardware reads no payload from the URDF (only robot_ip and arm_id), so an <inertial>
# block in fr3_polyumi.urdf.xacro would change nothing here — setLoad or Desk are the only levers.

# In fr3_hand, which uses the same frame orientation as TCP_XYZ, so the two are directly comparable
# (see the linear offset in TCP_XYZ above, positioned at the fingertips). setLoad wants it in the FLANGE,
# which is a 45 deg yaw away — payload_com_flange() does
# that conversion off HAND_STATIC_TRANSFORMS. Do not write flange coordinates here.

# guesswork; I'd say CoM is about 1/3 of the way along the fingers due to GoPro being far back.
# and then about 40mm up (which is +x in this frame) from the finger surface, again due to the gopro
# and finally a bit to the right (so +y), looking out from the camera, due to the shape of the gopro.

# The FR3 firmware validates the tensor before it looks at anything else, and a nonzero mass with a
# zero inertia is a physical impossibility it rejects outright:
#
#     libfranka: Set Load command rejected: invalid argument!
#
# So this cannot be left at zero the way UMI, SERL and polymetis leave it — they all reach the load
# through Desk, which derives a tensor for them. It is approximated as a uniform solid box, which is
# both good enough (inertia only enters the acceleration terms, and we move slowly) and self-
# consistent by construction: the principal moments of a real box always satisfy the triangle
# inequality the firmware checks, at whatever mass.
#
# Bounding box of the whole assembly past the flange, metres, ordered (x, y, z) in fr3_hand.
# fr3_hand frame is at the flange. z is the approach axis out through the fingers, x is up (ie out
# from the ArUco tag face of the fingers), and y is to the right (along the finger travel axis).
# Estimate it from the CAD.
#
# The box is used to compute a 3x3 inertia matrix, which is then fed into setLoad() load_inertia
# argument. This matrix describes the inertia about the CoM, and thus the box is defined
# to be centered at the CoM.
#
# Known limitation, deliberately accepted: the box is uniformly dense, which PAYLOAD_COM_HAND
# already contradicts — that offset exists precisely because the GoPro is heavy and set back. So
# the tensor is the right order of magnitude and the right shape, not a measurement.
# Empirically that seems to be enough here; inertia only enters in the acceleration terms
# for the gravity compensation, and we're not accelerating terribly fast or far in general.
