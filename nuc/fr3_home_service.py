"""
FR3 homing service — runs ON THE NUC (ROS 2 Humble).

Serves /polyumi/home (std_srvs/Trigger): a joint-space move to the SRDF `ready` pose, planned
and executed through the LOCAL move_group. This node must run on the NUC, not the laptop: the
laptop (rmw_cyclonedds 4.0.2, Kilted) and the NUC (rmw_cyclonedds 1.3.4, Humble) can exchange
small messages fine, but the large nested MoveIt action goals (MoveGroup.Goal /
ExecuteTrajectory.Goal) get corrupted across the rmw-major boundary ("invalid data size, at
serdata.cpp:384" -> move_group "Catastrophic failure"). Keeping the move_group calls same-rmw
(NUC-local) avoids that.

Self-contained (no PolyUMI package deps) so it runs from a plain clone on the NUC:
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    source ~/franka_ws/install/setup.bash   # move_group + franka must be up (fr3-bringup)
    export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
    export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://$HOME/franka_ws/config/cyclonedds.xml
    python3 nuc/fr3_home_service.py

Serves /polyumi/set_home (std_srvs/Trigger) alongside it: record wherever the arm is standing
right now as the pose /polyumi/home drives to, persisted so it survives the next bringup. The
pair is what makes eval trials repeatable -- teach the start pose once by moving the arm there,
then begin every trial with /polyumi/home.

Callable from the laptop despite the rmw gap, as long as the type is given explicitly (the ROS
*graph* does not cross Humble<->Kilted, so `ros2 node list` and node-name lookups come back
empty, but service calls match on DDS endpoints and work fine):

    ros2 service call /polyumi/set_home std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"   # teach (does NOT move)
    ros2 service call /polyumi/home     std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"   # MOVES THE ARM
