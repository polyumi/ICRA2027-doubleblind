# PolyUMI: everything the NUC needs for inference ON TOP of a running hardware session.
#
# Collapses three terminals (move_group + the two bridges) into one. All three are plain ROS
# nodes with no hardware handshake, so they start together, fail together, and restart together
# without touching the arm's state.
#
# They are separate from fr3_bringup.launch.py on purpose — see the note at the top of that
# file. Start bringup first; this file's nodes all tolerate being started before their peers
# (move_group waits, the bridges log a "server NOT found" error and keep spinning), but the
# arm controller must already exist or move_group comes up with nothing to execute through.

"""
Launch the NUC-side inference stack: move_group plus the PolyUMI target bridges.

Run on the NUC, after fr3_bringup.launch.py is up:

    ros2 launch nuc/launch/fr3_inference.launch.py                       # dry run, nothing moves
    ros2 launch nuc/launch/fr3_inference.launch.py execute_gripper:=true # fingers only
    ros2 launch nuc/launch/fr3_inference.launch.py execute_arm:=true     # servo drives the arm

`gripper:=faulhaber|hand|none` picks the driver (faulhaber is the supported one);
`execute_gripper` decides whether it is started at all.

The streaming Cartesian impedance controller is loaded inactive and only ACTIVATED once
`execute_arm:=true`; otherwise it sits loaded but idle and nothing moves.

See docs/lab-fr3-inference.md for the full bringup order and its gotchas.
