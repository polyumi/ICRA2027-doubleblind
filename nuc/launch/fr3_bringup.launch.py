# PolyUMI: the FR3 *hardware session*, as one launch file.
#
# Replaces the two-terminal `fr3-bringup` + `fr3-arm-controller` alias dance. Those were split
# only because the controller spawner has to run AFTER controller_manager exists — not because
# they are independent things. They are one unit: restarting bringup tears down
# controller_manager, which drops the controller, so the spawner has to run again anyway.
#
# What is deliberately NOT in here: move_group and the two PolyUMI bridges. Those live in
# fr3_inference.launch.py, so this file can be restarted on its own — which matters, because
# per docs/lab-fr3-inference.md ("When it doesn't come up") this is the component that crashes
# mid-session, and it is also the one gated on enabling FCI in the Desk UI by hand.

Launch the FR3 hardware session: franka_bringup plus the arm controller.

Run on the NUC, after enabling FCI on the Desk UI:

        Aborting rather than warning-and-continuing, because this failure is both critical and easy
        to miss. It is the last moment the payload can be set: the spawner immediately puts the
        robot in "Move" mode, where setLoad is rejected, so a session that gets past here keeps a
        wrong gravity model until someone deactivates every controller. And the symptom — TCP droop

        arm. Better to have bringup refuse to come up, which is loud, immediate, and safe.
