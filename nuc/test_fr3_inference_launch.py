Check that `gripper` and `execute_gripper` select exactly one driver, or none.

The two grippers are mutually exclusive hardware and both claim their device on startup, so
"which one starts" is the one branch in this launch file that can do damage by being wrong.
Evaluating the conditions needs no ROS graph, no hardware, and no NUC.
