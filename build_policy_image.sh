# build_policy_image.sh - Select a policy fork and build its image, in two stages.
#
# Sourced by train_policy.sh and serve_policy.sh so both roles run a byte-identical image --
# checkpoints are dill-pickled and must unpickle against the exact dependency tree they were
# trained with, so a training image and a serving image that differ is a class of bug that only
# shows up at load time.
#
# Also runnable on its own, to build without starting a run:
#   POLICY=vista ./build_policy_image.sh
#
# Two stages because a fork's Dockerfile builds with the FORK DIRECTORY as its context and so
# cannot see inference_server/. See docker/polyumi_inference.Dockerfile for why the alternatives
# (staging a copy into the fork; moving the fork to a repo-root context) are worse.
#
#   stage 1  the fork: conda env + torch + the policy code                ~23 min cold, cached after
#   stage 2  polyumi_inference on top                                     seconds
#
# Layer caching makes this cheaper than a single build would be: editing the shared library
# rebuilds only stage 2. The stage-1 solve is NOT shared between forks -- each has its own conda
# env, so the first build of a new policy pays the ~23 minutes again.

# Resolve POLICY -> POLICY_DIR, IMAGE, CONFIG_NAME, TRAIN_CMD, SERVE_CMD, DATASET_MNT.
#
# The wiring lives in the PARENT repo (config/policy.<name>.env), not in the forks: it is a set of
# facts about how PolyUMI drives a fork -- its path under external/, its image tag, its entrypoint
# -- which a submodule cannot know about itself and which must be readable before there is anything
# checked out to read. Same pattern as config/env.<hostname>.sh.
#
# Hyperparameters stay in each fork's own Hydra tree; CONFIG_NAME only selects which workspace yaml.
#
# Returns non-zero rather than calling exit, since this file is meant to be sourced: an exit here
# would kill an interactive shell that sourced it. Callers run under `set -e`, so an unchecked
# call still aborts the script.
