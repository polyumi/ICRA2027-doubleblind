# Bring up the whole FR3 inference wall — NUC, Pi, polyumi-server — as one tmux session.
#
#     ./fr3_session.sh                # create (or re-attach to) the session
#     SKIP_DEPLOY=1 ./fr3_session.sh  # ...without re-syncing the remote source trees first
#     ./fr3_session.sh --kill-local   # tear down the LOCAL session only (remote ones survive)
#     ./fr3_session.sh --kill         # ...and stop the remote sessions too
#
# This machine is only a terminal. ROS and the policy server both run on polyumi-server, so the inference
# request never leaves that box and the laptop can sleep mid-run without consequence.
#
# WHAT AUTO-RUNS, AND WHAT ONLY GETS TYPED
# Commands that are safe and order-independent are RUN for you. Commands that need a decision
# (which checkpoint, whether the arm is allowed to move) are PRE-TYPED at the prompt but not
# executed — read the line, edit it, press Enter. Nothing here can move the robot on its own.
#
# WHERE TMUX RUNS, AND WHY IT MATTERS
# The remote panes run tmux *on the remote host* (`ssh -t host tmux new -A -s ...`), not a bare
# ssh, so a laptop sleep or a wifi blip costs nothing — re-running this script re-attaches. It
# also gets an interactive shell, so ~/.bashrc's DDS env and fr3-* aliases are simply there;
# `ssh host 'cmd'` comes up without them, on the wrong RMW, invisible to everything else.
# The Pi is a plain ssh: it is stateless and cheap to restart, so the extra layer buys nothing.
#
# WHERE THE LOGS GO
# The launches that can crash tee their console output to ~/.local/state/polyumi/<name>_<date>.log
# on the machine that ran them. ROS's own ~/.ros/log does not capture this: franka_bringup
# launches with output='screen', and a C++ crash message is raw stderr rather than rcl logging,
# so the line naming the fault reaches the terminal and nowhere else.
#
# Every fresh start (not a re-attach) also makes each machine run this working copy. See "Deploy".

  2. nuc, right          the inference stack — check the execute flags on the line before you run it
  3. polyumi-pi, right   the policy server — edit CKPT to the checkpoint you want
  4. ros-client          the client, last

Send the arm home (needs pane 2 running; MOVES THE ARM even in plan-only mode):
  ros2 service call /polyumi/home std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"

Gripper only, for a first run — edit pane 2's line down to:
  ros2 launch nuc/launch/fr3_inference.launch.py gripper:=$GRIPPER execute_gripper:=true
Then, from the ros-client pane, the acceptance test (MOVES THE FINGERS):
  ros2 run polyumi_ros2 latency_probe --ros-args -p mode:=gripper_chirp

Running gripper:=faulhaber? Bring the bus up on the NUC and, on a NUC that has never been
calibrated, find the hard stops once (SWEEPS THE FULL STROKE — clear the mechanism first):
  ssh $NUC_SSH_HOST 'sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000'
  ros2 service call /faulhaber_gripper/calibrate std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"
It tracks nothing until that succeeds. The result persists in ~/.ros/ across launches.

Running gripper:=hand? franka_hand_node logs every move(width, speed) it issues in pane 2, at
0.7-1.7 Hz. That ceiling is the hand, not a fault: docs/lab-fr3-inference.md, "Gripper problems".

tmux, minimum viable:
  C-b n / C-b p    next / previous window        C-b o     next pane
  C-b d            detach (everything keeps running)
  C-b C-b          send a prefix to the INNER tmux on $NUC_SSH_HOST/$ROS_SSH_HOST
