# polyumi-server's link to the FR3 NUC. Sourced by setup_franka_env.sh when `hostname` is polyumi-server.
#
# polyumi-server reaches the NUC over its own NetworkManager profile ("direct") bound to enp37s0f1, on a
# 192.168.100.x subnet — not the laptop's fr3-link / enp0s31f6 / 10.0.0.x. Interface name AND peer
# addresses both differ, which is why the DDS side names a whole config file rather than one field.
#
# `:=` throughout, so an exported override still wins over this file.
