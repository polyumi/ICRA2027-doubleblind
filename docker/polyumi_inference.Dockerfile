# Layers polyumi_inference onto the diffusion-policy image.
#
# Two stages, rather than one, because the fork's own Dockerfile builds with the FORK DIRECTORY as
# its context and so cannot see inference_server/. The alternatives were worse: staging a copy of
# the library into the fork re-introduces exactly the duplicated file this library exists to delete,
# and switching the fork to a repo-root context would make a submodule's Dockerfile reference
# parent-repo paths, so the fork could no longer be built on its own.
#
# This build's context is inference_server/ itself -- 180 KB, six files -- so the extra stage costs
# a couple of seconds. It is also cheaper than a single build would be: editing the library rebuilds
# only these two layers and never touches the ~23-minute conda solve underneath.
#
# Built by train_policy.sh and serve_policy.sh, which both run both stages so the two roles keep
# running a byte-identical image (checkpoints are dill-pickled against the exact dep tree).
#
#   docker build -t polyumi-dp-base external/polyumi_diffusion_policy
#   docker build -t polyumi-dp -f docker/polyumi_inference.Dockerfile inference_server
