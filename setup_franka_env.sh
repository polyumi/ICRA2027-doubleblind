# toggleable NetworkManager profile. Confined to this script so the default /
# old-arm workflow is untouched when not sourced.
# See docs/lab-fr3-inference.md for the full topology and rationale.

# Abort if executed instead of sourced, before nmcli makes any changes — if we let execution
# continue, the NM profile side effect would run but the exported env vars would be discarded
# with the subshell, silently leaving the caller's shell unconfigured.
#   - zsh: `return` at the top level of a script behaves like `exit` (always "succeeds"), so
#     it can't be used to detect sourcing there. Check ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT instead — it ends in
#     ":file" when sourced, and is exactly "toplevel" when executed directly (verified).
#   - bash/sh: `return` outside a function only succeeds when the script is sourced.
