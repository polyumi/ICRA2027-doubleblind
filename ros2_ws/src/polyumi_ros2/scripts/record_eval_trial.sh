# ros2 bag has to run where the topics are and polyumi-server has 11 TB free. The Seagate is on the laptop,
# so copying there is a separate step -- see the rsync line this prints when it finishes. Writing
# a multi-hundred-MB bag straight to a network mount would drop messages, not just run slow.
#
# WHAT IT RECORDS, and why not more. The whole point is that a trial can be re-judged later
# without the robot, so this keeps every observation the policy saw, every command it issued, and
# the diagnostics that explain a bad rollout -- and deliberately drops the one topic that would
# dwarf all of them.
