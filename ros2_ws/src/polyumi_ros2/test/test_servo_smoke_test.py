"""
Tests for the servo smoke test's trajectory geometry and its configuration guards.

This node exists to prove the interpolator splices overlapping chunks smoothly, so the two things
worth pinning are that the path it publishes is actually continuous and starts where the arm
already is, and that a configuration which quietly stops testing the splice is rejected rather than
run. Both would otherwise look fine on hardware and tell you nothing.
