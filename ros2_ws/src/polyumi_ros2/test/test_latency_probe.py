"""
Tests for the latency probe's parameter guards and signal handling.

The estimator itself is covered in test_latency_util; what is left here is everything that decides
whether the estimator gets fed something meaningful. Those are the quiet failures: a chirp that
aliases against the command rate, an amplitude the hand node's deadband swallows whole, or a
QR dedup that biases every offset upward. Each produces a plausible-looking number that then goes
into a robot config, so each gets a test.
