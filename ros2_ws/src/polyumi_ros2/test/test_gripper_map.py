"""
Tests for the policy<->robot gripper width conversion.

The conversion is two lines of arithmetic, but it sits on a path where being wrong is invisible:
a bad offset just commands a systematically-too-open or too-closed hand, and a bad clamp just
saturates. Neither raises. These pin the direction of the conversion (the sign is the easy thing
to flip) and the clamping behaviour.
