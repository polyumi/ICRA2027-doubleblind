"""
Measure the system latencies ``config/inference.yaml`` guesses at, one mode per quantity.

The inference loop compensates latency in three places — the TF pose lookup, the gripper-width
lookup, and ``t_obs`` for action-chunk truncation — and until now every constant feeding them was a
plausible guess. This probe replaces the guesses with measurements, porting the two estimators
upstream UMI uses (``scripts/calibrate_uvc_camera_latency.py`` and
``scripts/calibrate_{robot,gripper}_latency.py``).

Only one constant in the whole observation->action budget actually needs calibrating, which is why
this is smaller than it looks::

    photon --(latency.gopro)--> header.stamp --(measured live)--> response --(*_exec)--> motion
            mode:=camera                       policy_client_node          mode:=arm / :=gripper
                                               already measures this

The trailing term is per device: the arm and the hand each have their own ``latency.*_exec`` and
``policy_client_node`` truncates their chunks separately, so the two are measured and configured
independently. Nothing here has to be reconciled against the other device.

``header.stamp`` is the earliest instant the laptop has any handle on, so ``mode:=camera`` measures
photon->stamp and everything downstream of the stamp — the YUYV convert, tick phasing, the POST, the
network, the server's own inference time — is already measured live by ``_n_stale_actions``, which
runs *after* the response lands and uses ``now() - t_obs``. There is deliberately no round-trip
constant to calibrate; a config value would be strictly worse than that live measurement.

Modes
-----

``mode:=camera``
    ``latency.gopro``. Displays a QR code encoding the current time, which the GoPro films off the
    screen; the lag is the mean of (frame stamp - encoded time), less the time the screen took to
    render. Needs no robot.

``mode:=arm``
    ``latency.arm_exec``. Chirps the commanded EEF pose along one axis and cross-correlates it
    against the ``polyumi_tcp`` TF. **Moves the arm.**

``mode:=gripper``
    ``latency.gripper_exec`` as a **step response** — command a step, time until the fingers start
    moving — plus the ``/fr3_gripper/joint_states`` publish interval that sets ``latency.gripper``.
    **Moves the fingers.**

``mode:=gripper_chirp``
    ``latency.gripper_exec`` by chirp-and-cross-correlate, the same estimator the arm uses.
    **Moves the fingers.**

The two gripper modes measure **different quantities**. The step times command -> *onset of motion*,
which bottoms out at the ~0.34 s libfranka firmware floor. The chirp measures how far the hand's
*width* lags the commanded width — the quantity ``gripper_exec`` actually needs, since it picks
which action index the hand is handed, so the hand should *be* at that width rather than merely
starting toward it.

The chirp publishes a full ``n_action_steps`` chunk led by ``lead_s``, the shape
``policy_client_node`` sends, and correlates against each chunk's scheduled instant rather than its
publication. So it measures lag against a *schedule* — and it is the only thing here that exercises
``franka_hand_node``'s scheduling branch, since a single already-due waypoint can only ever be
chased. ``mode:=gripper`` stays a bare "be here now" step, and remains the source of the shipped
``gripper_exec``.

Usage (laptop, after ``source setup_franka_env.sh``)::

    # 1. camera — point the GoPro at the laptop screen, filling the frame, and focused
    ros2 launch polyumi_ros2 stream_demo.launch.xml motion_only:=true
    ros2 run polyumi_ros2 latency_probe --ros-args -p mode:=camera

    # 2. arm — NUC: ros2 launch nuc/launch/fr3_inference.launch.py execute_arm:=true
    ros2 service call /polyumi/home std_srvs/srv/Trigger "{}"   # a roomy pose; edge poses fail to plan
    ros2 run polyumi_ros2 latency_probe --ros-args -p mode:=arm

    # 3. gripper — NUC: ... execute_gripper:=true, and nothing between the fingers
    ros2 run polyumi_ros2 latency_probe --ros-args -p mode:=gripper
    ros2 run polyumi_ros2 latency_probe --ros-args -p mode:=gripper_chirp   # -p duration_s:=40 for more cycles

Each mode prints the number, its quality, and the exact line to paste, then saves the raw series to
``.npz`` so a marginal run can be re-judged without booking the hardware again. Pass ``-p
plot:=false`` on a headless box (``mode:=camera`` needs a screen regardless — it is the light
source).

**Do not run the arm or gripper modes while policy_client_node is up.** They publish to the same
topics and the bridges act on whichever chunk arrived last.

        `Move` goals at 0.7-1.7 Hz, so read `peak_corr` before anything else — under MIN_PEAK_CORR
        the reported lag is meaningless whatever it says. Historically this mode never cleared its
        own gates: swept 0.3-0.7 Hz at +/-30 mm on 2026-08-20 the hand was stationary for 76% of
