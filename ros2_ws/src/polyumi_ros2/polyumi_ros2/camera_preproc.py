"""
The camera preprocessing contracts, inference side.

This MUST stay in lock-step with ``polyumi_ingest.camera_preproc``: the policy only compares
like with like, so the frames the DP exporter bakes into training and the frames this node
feeds the policy have to go through the same pixel transforms. The two packages can't share a
Python import (ROS venv vs. uv workspace), so the contracts are duplicated here on purpose. See
``docs/data-format.md`` ("Camera preprocessing contracts").

* ``camera0_rgb`` (:func:`resize_camera0_rgb`) — RGB ``(H,W,3)`` uint8 in → centre-cropped to
  the GoPro's 4:3 recording aspect (a no-op if already 4:3) → ``(224,224,3)`` uint8 out,
  squashed with ``cv2.INTER_AREA`` (anti-aliased downscale). The ``float32/255`` normalization
  is applied by the node after this, not here.
* ``finger_rgb`` (:func:`crop_finger_rgb`) — the finger camera, cropped to given bounds because
  the gripper mount occludes a fixed strip of its view. **Nothing in this package calls it
  yet:** ``policy_client_node`` has no finger-camera subscription. It is mirrored here now so
  that wiring is a subscription rather than a second derivation of a transform the exporter
  already pinned.

    on them. Inference frames come off the Elgato at 1920x1080, and the GoPro's clean-HDMI output
    **pillarboxes** that same 4:3 image into 16:9: measured on hardware, the content occupies
    columns 240..1679 exactly, with pure black bars either side. So the field of view is
    identical; without this crop the inference frame would carry 480 columns of black the policy
    never saw in training, and squeeze the real content into 3/4 of the width.

    Cropping rather than letterbox-padding is what keeps the two identical: it recovers precisely
    the 1440x1080 the camera framed, so both paths squash the same field of view.

    black bars. If that assumption is ever wrong — a GoPro configured to a genuine 16:9 mode, a
    capture card doing its own scaling, a ``gopro.mp4`` recorded at some other aspect — the crop
    silently removes a quarter of the real field of view instead. That is the same invisible
    train/inference skew the crop exists to fix, just pointing the other way: the policy keeps
    running, on pixels nobody chose.

    Crop a finger-camera frame to its useful region, optionally resizing the result.

    Unlike :func:`crop_to_source_aspect`, whose geometry is derived from the frame's aspect, this
    crop is *given* — the gripper mount occludes a fixed strip of the finger camera's view, and
    which strip is a property of the hardware, not of the image. The bounds are half-open
    ``[min, max)``; ``None`` means the frame's own edge, so the geometry survives a change of
    camera resolution rather than silently landing somewhere else.

    ``output_size`` is ``(width, height)``, or ``None`` to keep the crop at its native size. The
    exporter's default is ``None``: the crop is then an exact array slice, identical in any numpy,
    and the choice of encoder input size stays with whoever builds the policy.

    Returns a contiguous copy, never a view onto ``frame_rgb`` — the inference side reads frames
    out of buffers that get recycled underneath it.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if a bound is negative, inverted, or past the edge of the frame. A crop
            configured for a different camera resolution would otherwise export a sliver of the
            intended region, which looks like a plausible image and is not one.
