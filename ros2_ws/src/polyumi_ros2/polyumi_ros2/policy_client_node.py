r"""
ROS2 node that drives the Franka arm using a remote diffusion policy inference server.

At each control tick the node:
  1. Reads the latest wrist camera image and a latency-compensated end-effector pose (looked
     up in TF at the frame's own stamp - latency.gopro, to align with when that image was
     actually captured).
  2. Maintains a short history window (n_obs_steps), appended every tick so the window stays
     dt-spaced regardless of how often inference runs.
  3. Once per ``steps_per_inference`` ticks (a receding-horizon stride — NOT every tick), POSTs
     observations to /predict_cartesian/ on the inference server, requesting an
     n_action_steps-length action chunk. Between inferences the arm keeps executing the
     previously published chunk, matching UMI (infer once per ~steps_per_inference*dt).
  4. Drops the leading actions of the returned chunk that are already stale by the time the
     arm could act on them (observation + inference + arm-execution latency).
  5. Logs the chunk. If execute_motion is set, publishes the remaining chunk on two topics for
     the NUC-side bridges: the pose half as a MultiDOFJointTrajectory on
     /polyumi/target_poses_traj (spliced by the streaming Cartesian impedance controller), and the
     gripper half as a JointTrajectory on /polyumi/target_gripper (franka_hand_node). The two
     ride separate channels because the pose message carries no width and because the Franka Hand
     is action-only, so it needs a different execution cadence entirely — see
     docs/lab-fr3-inference.md ("Gripper problems").

        Look up eef_frame in base_frame, time-aligned to the gopro frame, and return the pose.

        The gopro image being paired with this pose was captured ~latency.gopro seconds before
        ``image_stamp`` (the v4l2 driver stamps a frame when it dequeues the buffer, which is
        already downstream of GoPro encode + HDMI out + capture card + USB transfer), so we
        look up the EE pose as of that same past instant — not the current one — to keep image
        and proprio in sync. This mirrors UMI's scheme, where each sensor's receive timestamp
        is corrected back to true capture time and the low-dim streams are then interpolated
        onto the camera's corrected clock.

        Anchoring on the frame's own stamp rather than the tick's wall clock matters because
        the two are decoupled: the camera runs at 60 Hz and the tick at control_hz, so
        `now()` overstates the frame's freshness by a jittering 0–1 camera periods.

        tf2's Buffer interpolates (linear + slerp) between the two nearest cached transforms
        automatically; buffers.ee_pose_s sizes the buffer's cache_time so the lookup stays in
        range. The gripper width gets the same treatment via _gripper_width_at, hand-rolled
