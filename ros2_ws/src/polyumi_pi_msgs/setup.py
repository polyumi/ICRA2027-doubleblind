    """
    Compile the protobuf files, generating .pyi type stubs when protoc supports them.

    The .pyi stubs need protoc's built-in --pyi_out generator, added in protobuf 3.20. We ask
    for it via grpcio-tools>=1.78 in this package's [build-system] requires, but that is only
    honoured by PEP 517 builds (pip install / python -m build). **colcon's ament_python build
    type runs this setup.py directly with the system interpreter**, so under `colcon build` the
    requirement is never installed and `grpc_tools` resolves to whatever the distro ships — on
    Ubuntu 24.04 that is grpcio-tools 1.14.1, bundling libprotoc 3.5.1. That protoc has no
    built-in pyi generator, so it looks for a `protoc-gen-pyi` plugin, finds none, and the whole
    build fails.

    The stubs are type hints only — nothing imports them at runtime — so a missing pyi generator
    should not break the build. Try with --pyi_out, and on failure fall back to generating just
    the _pb2.py modules with a warning. Version-sniffing protoc is avoided deliberately: its
    scheme has changed twice (3.20 -> 4.21 -> 25.x), whereas "try it and see" is version-proof.
