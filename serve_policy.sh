# serve_policy.sh - Build and run the PolyUMI diffusion-policy inference server.
#
# Host-side orchestration for the GPU workstation (rootless Docker), mirroring train_policy.sh:
# it wires the checkpoint + HF-cache mounts and the rootless-safe run flags, then runs the
# container's serve entrypoint (docker/serve.sh -> uvicorn serve_policy:app). serve_policy.py
# serves the trained policy over POST /predict_cartesian/ + /reset; the ROS-side
# policy_client_node POSTs to it. Full walkthrough in docs/training-instructions.md.
#
# NOTE: external/polyumi_diffusion_policy/docker/serve.sh is the IN-CONTAINER entrypoint and will
# NOT run on the host ("exec: uvicorn: not found") — the umi conda env only exists in the image.
# Always launch via this script (or a raw `docker run ... bash docker/serve.sh`).
#
# Usage:
#   CKPT=/abs/path/to/epoch=0070-....ckpt ./serve_policy.sh
#   CKPT=... PORT=8001 ./serve_policy.sh
#   CKPT=... CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 ./serve_policy.sh    # pin to the second GPU
#   POLICY=vista CKPT=... ./serve_policy.sh              # serve a checkpoint from another fork
#
# POLICY selects the fork the same way train_policy.sh does (config/policy.<name>.env). It must
# match the fork the checkpoint was trained with -- checkpoints are dill-pickled against their
# image's dep tree and will not unpickle against another's.
#
# serve_policy.py loads the policy on plain 'cuda', i.e. whatever CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES makes
# device 0. Not defaulted here: which card is quiet changes hour to hour, so check `nvidia-smi`.

# SERVE_TACTILE is forwarded by name, not value: the Vista fork's serve_policy.py reads it to
# decide whether finger_rgb and mic_0 are required channels, and it must agree with the ROS
# node's send_tactile. Unset on the host it stays unset in the container, which is what dp wants.
