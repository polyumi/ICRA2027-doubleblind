Make the package importable when pytest is run directly against this directory.

Under colcon the package is installed before its tests run, so this is not needed there. Run bare
— ``pytest test/``, or as part of a wider sweep over the checkout — nothing has put the package
root on ``sys.path``, and the import fails at collection.
