/// Franka Hand probe: where does the commanded speed stop being honoured?
//
// Commands speeds far past anything the hand can deliver (up to 800 mm/s) and reads the answer
// off move()'s BLOCKING DURATION rather than the width trace. That matters: above ~150 mm/s a
// full stroke lasts fewer than three 5 Hz width refreshes, so the width can no longer measure a
// speed -- but move() returning is timed to the microsecond. If the hand saturates at some
// xdot_max, blocked time stops falling as the commanded speed rises, and the knee is the answer.
//
// Each speed is run at TWO stroke lengths (60 mm and 30 mm). With one stroke length a term that
// scales with distance and one that depends only on speed are indistinguishable; two lengths
// separate them, which is what the return-time model needs.
//
// Writes samples and commands as two CSVs; analysis lives in Python. MOVES THE FINGERS.
