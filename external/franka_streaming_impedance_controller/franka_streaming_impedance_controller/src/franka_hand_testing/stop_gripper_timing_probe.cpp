/// Franka Hand timing probe that pre-empts every Move with stop().
//
// Same free-running reader as csv_gripper_timing_probe, but every Move is cut short by
// gripper.stop(), and the next Move goes out as soon as stop() returns. The question is whether
// stop() is a usable pre-emption primitive.
//
// The Move runs at a DELIBERATELY SLOW speed so the stroke lasts ~5 s, and the stop offset is
// swept from before the fingers have started to most of the way through. At full speed the whole
// stroke is only ~1.2 s, which is too little range to tell "stop is queued behind the Move" from
// "stop was sent too late to matter" -- and only ~6 width refreshes wide, so a halt is hard to see.
// Slow travel puts ~2 mm between refreshes, making a mid-stroke halt unmistakable.
//
// Targets alternate, so the fingers oscillate around mid-stroke rather than walking into a stop.
//
// Writes samples and commands as two CSVs; analysis lives in Python. MOVES THE FINGERS.
