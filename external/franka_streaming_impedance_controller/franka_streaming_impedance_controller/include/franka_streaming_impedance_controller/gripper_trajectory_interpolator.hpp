// The Franka Hand's answer to PoseTrajectoryInterpolator, and a very different problem.
//
// The arm takes a continuous reference at 1 kHz. The hand takes discrete, blocking, un-preemptable
// Move commands at under 2 Hz, so there is nothing to interpolate *to* — the question is instead
// which setpoint each Move should aim at, and how fast. That needs a model of what a Move costs,
// which is what the first half of this header is. Its constants were fitted in a Jupyter notebook
// from runs of the franka_hand_testing probes (see that directory); the notebook is not in the repo.

/**
 * Measured response of the Franka Hand to a Move.
 *
 * Every field is a knob rather than a constant because `fixed_cost` drifts 50-70 ms between runs,
 * and because `t_obs_delay` is a guess nobody can currently measure.
 *
 * Note which constants are contaminated by `t_obs_delay` and which are not, because it decides
 * where the correction is applied. `v_max`, `a_max` and `fixed_cost` were all timed off move()'s
 * blocking duration -- both endpoints inside our own process, microseconds, no width sample
 * anywhere -- so they are clean. `cmd_delay` was recovered from the width trace, so it is
 * `physical delay + t_obs_delay` and must have the observation lag taken back out before it is
 * used to schedule anything.
