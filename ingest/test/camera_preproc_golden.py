"""
Golden vectors for the camera preprocessing contracts — the single copy, read by both sides.

The contract itself is implemented twice, once per Python environment
(``polyumi_ingest.camera_preproc`` and ``polyumi_ros2.camera_preproc``), because the two cannot
share an import: ``polyumi_ingest`` requires Python >= 3.13 while the ROS node runs Ubuntu 24.04's
``/usr/bin/python3`` (3.12), and it would drag ``polyumi_pi``/zarr/scipy into the inference
process. See ``docs/data-format.md`` ("Camera preprocessing contracts").

Identical *source* is not the guarantee that matters, though — identical *output* is. The two
environments run different library majors (measured 2026-08-09: ROS ``cv2 4.6.0`` /
``numpy 1.26.4``, the uv workspace ``cv2 4.13.0`` / ``numpy 2.4.3``), so ``cv2.resize`` is a
different C++ implementation on each side regardless of how the Python is shared. Pinning the
bytes is the only check that covers that.

So the expectations live here, once, and both test suites read *this file*: the ingest suite
imports it (pytest puts ``ingest/test`` on ``sys.path``), and
``ros2_ws/src/polyumi_ros2/test/test_camera_preproc.py`` loads it **by path**. Two copies of the
digests could drift apart silently and would then be asserting nothing; one copy cannot. Both
contracts live here for that reason, sharing the one :func:`golden_frame`.

**Moving or renaming this file breaks the ROS-side test** — it hardcodes the path. Grep first.

Dependency-free beyond numpy, deliberately, so the ROS venv can execute it.
