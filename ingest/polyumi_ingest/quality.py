"""
Automatic episode-usability verdicts derived from stored SLAM quality metrics.

The metrics themselves live in each episode's ``annotations/slam`` attrs, written by
``OrbSlam3Step`` (preprocessing step 2). This module turns those numbers into a
usable/unusable verdict using thresholds from ``config/quality_thresholds.yaml``.

* **Derived, never stored.** No verdict is written into the pzarr, so editing the
  threshold file reclassifies every scene at once with no reprocessing. The pzarr
  holds measurements; this module holds policy.

**This is a prediction, not the export's gate.** The exporter cuts a session into segments at
its dropouts and pose jumps (``export.dp.buffer.plan_episode_segments``), so holes do not
condemn an episode; the only thing decided here is whether an episode is too short to yield
any segment at all. The real rule needs the pose array, which this module must not read: the
catalog calls it on every page render and is attrs-only by design.

The two are related in one direction only, asserted in ``test_dp_export.py``: whatever this
module calls unusable, the export really does produce nothing from. The reverse does not hold.

An episode listed explicitly in ``scene.json``'s ``unusable_episodes`` is unusable regardless
of these thresholds — that human set is the only thing that discards a whole session at export.

    stricter than a v4 one on the same episode, since it counts the idle pre-chirp prefix
    where the localizer is still relocalizing.

    A post-chirp window shorter than the export's own floor is the one case where the exporter

    Human-readable reasons this episode is automatically unusable; empty means usable.

    ``slam_attrs`` is an episode's ``annotations/slam`` attrs (``None``/empty when
    step 2 hasn't run — treated as "nothing to judge", i.e. usable, so an
    unprocessed scene isn't spuriously condemned).

    ``has_optitrack`` short-circuits every check when the thresholds allow it: such
    an episode's pose source doesn't depend on SLAM at all.

    The tracked count is of frames SLAM was *fed*, not every GoPro frame — see
    ``_fed_frame_counts`` and the config file. At a stride above 1 the localizer never sees the
    other frames, so a whole-grid count would reject the entire corpus.

    This is a **necessary condition, not a sufficient one**, and only a prediction: an episode
    with fewer tracked frames than the export's length floor cannot contain a run at least that
    long, so it is safe to say it will contribute nothing. The converse does not follow —
    plenty of episodes clear this bar and still export nothing once their tracked frames turn
    out to be scattered in runs that are each too short. Only the exporter knows that, because
    only the exporter reads the pose array; see ``export.dp.buffer.plan_episode_segments``.

    Holes and teleports are deliberately not judged here: both are things segmentation cuts
    around, so condemning a whole session for them would discard the good runs either side.
