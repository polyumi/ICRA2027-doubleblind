    Contact-mic waveform on the exported step grid, as ``mic_0`` of shape ``(T, stride * B)``.

    Raw waveform, not a spectrogram, on purpose: the policy's log-mel is computed in the training
    container after augmentation that only exists in the waveform domain, and the mel parameters
    are hyperparameters we would otherwise be freezing at ingest time. See
    ``docs/maniwav-audio-policy.md``.

    Each row is the ``stride`` per-frame blocks belonging to one step, concatenated. Step 6
    anchors every frame's block at that frame's own timestamp with a width no smaller than the
    largest gap between anchors, so consecutive blocks abut or overlap — which is what makes the
    concatenation a gapless waveform, and in turn what ManiWAV's ``down_sample_steps: 1`` audio
    path assumes when it flattens the rows back into one signal before the mel.

    Whether a step's audio comes from before or after its observation instant is
    ``block_alignment`` in ``config/contact_audio.yaml``. That choice is a row shift applied here
    rather than in step 6, so changing it is a re-export rather than a re-preprocess.
