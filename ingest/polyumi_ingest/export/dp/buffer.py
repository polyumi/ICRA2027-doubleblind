Export a pzarr scene to a UMI-format ReplayBuffer (``.zarr.zip``).

The layout matches ``universal_manipulation_interface``'s ``ReplayBuffer`` so that
``UmiDataset`` reads it directly — the key *names* are load-bearing (the sampler counts
robots via ``key.endswith('eef_pos')``, picks Slerp vs linear interp via ``'rot' in key``,
and ``get_normalizer`` raises on any low-dim key it can't name-match)::

    <output>.zarr.zip
      meta/episode_ends                 (n_episodes,) int64, cumulative step counts
      data/camera0_rgb                  (T,224,224,3) uint8  Blosc(zstd), chunks (1,224,224,3)
      data/robot0_eef_pos               (T,3)  float32  hand-frame position
      data/robot0_eef_rot_axis_angle    (T,3)  float32  hand-frame rotation as a rotvec
      data/robot0_gripper_width         (T,1)  float32  metres of opening from fully closed
      data/robot0_demo_start_pose       (T,6)  float32  episode's first [pos, rotvec], repeated
      data/robot0_demo_end_pose         (T,6)  float32  episode's last  [pos, rotvec], repeated

Deliberately absent:

* ``action`` — ``sampler.py`` synthesises it from
  ``[eef_pos, eef_rot_axis_angle, gripper_width]`` when the key is missing, so writing it
  would be redundant (and would have to be kept in lock-step with the obs keys).
* ``robot0_eef_rot_axis_angle_wrt_start`` — ``UmiDataset`` derives it at load time from
  ``demo_start_pose``. It is in ``shape_meta`` but must *not* be in the store.
* tactile (piezo / finger camera) — out of scope for the *visuomotor* policy. The contact
  mic is exported by ``--type polyumi``, which runs this same code with a modality attached;
  see ``export.dp.modality`` and ``export.dp.polyumi``.

Poses come from one of each episode's ``eef/pose_<source>`` arrays (preprocessing step 5 writes
one per available source — ``optitrack`` and/or ``slam``), already on the canonical **hand**
body frame and on the GoPro frame grid. Step 5 no longer picks a single winner; *this* exporter
does, per episode: an episode's ``eef.attrs['default_source']`` (OptiTrack if present, else
SLAM) unless overridden by ``scene.json``'s ``pose_source_overrides`` (keyed by session
directory name, same pattern as ``unusable_episodes``) — see ``resolve_pose_source``. Changing
the source is therefore a re-*export*, not a re-preprocess. Quaternion → rotvec is the only pose
transform here. The world frame is left as-is: it cancels out of the relative trajectory the
policy trains on, whereas the body frame does not — which is why step 5 exists. See
``EefPoseStep`` and ``transforms.retarget_body_frame``.

Each exported episode's resolved source is recorded as **provenance**: alongside the returned
episode count, ``export_scenes_to_dp``/``export_scene_to_dp`` return a list of per-episode
provenance dicts (scene, session, episode, source, world_frame, n_steps, segment, frame_range,
frame_stride), which callers can persist externally (see ``main.py``'s ``<output>.provenance.json`` sidecar and the
catalog's ``DatasetManifest``). The same information is also written into the ``.zarr.zip``
itself, as ``meta.attrs['pose_provenance']`` (the full list) and ``meta.attrs['episode_pose_source']``
(just the per-episode source strings, aligned with ``episode_ends``) — ``UmiDataset`` only ever
reads ``meta/episode_ends``, so these extra attrs are inert cargo it ignores.

Steps are the frames SLAM was **fed** — every ``localization_frame_stride``-th GoPro frame, so
~30 Hz at the current stride of 2, not the 59.94 Hz the camera records at. Poses exist only on
that grid (nothing is interpolated), and Δt stays uniform, which is all UMI's dataset requires;
it sets the observation rate from there via ``obs_down_sample_steps`` in the task config. That
knob and this stride are coupled: halving the stored rate must halve ``obs_down_sample_steps``
or the policy trains on a different Δt than it runs at.

One session can produce **several episodes**. The session is cut wherever the trajectory stops
being trustworthy — the pose source has no pose (SLAM lost tracking), the gripper width is
missing, a modality stops covering the span, or the hand position steps further between two
adjacent frames than ``max_pose_jump_m`` (a relocalization teleport) — and each contiguous run
either side is exported as its own episode. Runs shorter than ``MIN_SEGMENT_STEPS`` are dropped.
Bridging a gap would put a step of the wrong duration inside an episode, which the fixed-rate
sampler cannot see; splitting keeps every episode honest. This follows the upstream UMI repo's
``scripts_slam_pipeline/06_generate_dataset_plan.py``. Each segment's provenance records
``cut_start``/``cut_end`` saying which of those causes bounded it.

**Cutting, not condemning.** There is no automatic whole-episode veto here: a session with holes
or a teleport is segmented around them rather than discarded, and the only thing that drops a
whole session is the human ``unusable_episodes`` set in ``scene.json``.
``polyumi_ingest.quality`` predicts, for the catalog alone, which episodes are too short to
yield anything — see that module's docstring for the one-way relationship between the two.
``pingest export --dry-run`` previews the whole plan without decoding a frame.

Images use **Blosc**, not JpegXl, on purpose. The training container pins Python 3.9 with
``imagecodecs==2023.9.18``, whose JpegXl codec cannot parse the config that our Python-3.13
``imagecodecs`` (2026.x) writes (``bitspersample``, ``squeeze``, ``usecontainer``, …), and no
single ``imagecodecs`` release supports both interpreters. Blosc is in ``numcodecs`` core, so
its config is byte-identical across both stacks; it is lossless, decodes faster than JpegXl,
and only costs disk.

GoPro frames are decoded on demand from each episode's ``gopro.mp4`` sidecar (via
``video_helpers.open_gopro_frames``) — the pzarr no longer stores a ``gopro/frames`` array.
The resize onto the 224x224 ``camera0_rgb`` grid goes through the shared
``camera_preproc.resize_camera0_rgb`` contract so it stays identical to what the inference
node feeds the policy.

The store is written ``zarr_format=2`` so the (v2-pinned) UMI zarr can read it, then packed
into a ``.zarr.zip`` because ``UmiDataset`` opens its dataset through ``zarr.ZipStore``.

**Extra observation streams** ride along as ``modalities`` (``export.dp.modality``), which
contribute additional ``data/<key>`` arrays inside the same segment loop, and may narrow the
validity mask where they have no observation — so a stream that stops before the others is
trimmed around like a pose dropout rather than failing the episode. With zero modalities
attached, this function's output — data keys, provenance sidecar, meta attrs — *is* the default
``--type dp`` contract; ``--type polyumi`` only ever adds to that output, never changes it.

``enforce_preprocessing`` requires only the steps an export actually reads —
``PreprocessingStep.required_for_export``, plus whatever its modalities declare. Demanding
every registered step instead would mean each new step stranded the entire existing corpus
until it was re-run, for an export that never looks at its output.

#: 10 Hz-policy-to-30 Hz-buffer conversion, so it is ~1.5 s, not 4.6 s.)
#:
#: 90 rather than 46 because 46 is a cliff edge — a 46-step segment yields exactly one sample.
#: Measured over 148 sessions, 90 is the shortest round floor at which no surviving segment
#: contributes fewer than five samples, and it costs ~4% of the total against the bare minimum.
#:
#: Steps, not seconds, because that is the unit the sampler's own constraint is in. The cost is
#: that the wall-clock meaning tracks ``localization_frame_stride`` — 3.0 s at stride 2, 1.5 s
#: at stride 1 — so ``EpisodePlan.min_seconds`` resolves it per episode for the logs. A buffer
#: may not mix strides, so within one dataset this always has one meaning.
