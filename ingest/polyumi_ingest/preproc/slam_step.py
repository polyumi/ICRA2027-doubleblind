    forgetting, not what you lose by it: an unmasked run doesn't crash, it quietly produces a
    map nothing relocalizes against, and the debug viewer forgetting it is exactly how you
    end up debugging a run that behaves unlike the one you're trying to reproduce. Pass

    Parse the localizer's CSV trajectory onto the full GoPro frame grid.

        frame_idx,timestamp,state,is_lost,is_keyframe,x,y,z,q_x,q_y,q_z,q_w

    Row ``k`` is therefore the k-th fed frame, i.e. original frame ``k * frame_stride`` --
    a direct index, which is why nothing here matches timestamps. (The EuRoC writer omitted
    lost frames entirely, so every row had to be matched back by time within half a frame
    period, and a mis-estimated anchor shifted poses silently.)

    Poses are in the **camera optical frame**: unlike ``SaveTrajectoryEuRoC``, whose inertial
    branch composes ``mTbc`` and reports the IMU body pose, this writer reports ``Twc``
    directly. See the note in ``mono_inertial_gopro_vi_localize.cc``.

        Initialize the ORB-SLAM3 step.

        Parameters
        ----------
        orb_slam3_dir:
            Root of the ORB-SLAM3 installation.
        settings_yaml:
            Camera/IMU settings YAML.  Defaults to the Hero 12 template.
        map_builder_bin:
            Binary filename under ``orb_slam3_dir/bin_subdir/`` for map building.
        localizer_bin:
            Binary filename under ``orb_slam3_dir/bin_subdir/`` for localization.
        bin_subdir:
            Subdirectory of ``orb_slam3_dir`` that contains the binaries.
            Defaults to ``Examples/Monocular-Inertial`` to match the in-repo
            ORB_SLAM3_PolyUMI build layout.
        timeout_s:
            Per-episode subprocess timeout; None = no timeout.
        resolution_divisor:
            Downsample factor applied to the camera settings for *both* passes.  Map
            building and localization must use the same value: ORB descriptors and the
            scale pyramid are resolution-dependent, so localizing against a
            resolution-mismatched atlas makes relocalization unreliable.  Read from
            ``config/slam.yaml`` unless overridden by ``POLYUMI_SLAM_RES_DIV``.
        localization_frame_stride:
            Feed every Nth frame to the *localizer* (2 ~= 30 fps from a 59.94 fps
            source).  Map building is deliberately left at full rate -- decimating it
            measured no benefit and 20 fps mapping failed outright.  Read from
            ``config/slam.yaml`` unless overridden by ``POLYUMI_SLAM_LOC_STRIDE``.

        Neither has an in-code default.  These two numbers decide what ORB-SLAM3 ever sees,
        and they are recorded per episode (``annotations/slam/frame_stride``) and enforced to
        be uniform across a DP export -- so a fallback quietly disagreeing with the
        checked-in config is exactly the failure that would split a corpus across two
        incompatible time bases.  ``config/slam.yaml`` is the single source of truth.

        Raises
        ------
        FileNotFoundError
            If ``config/slam.yaml`` is missing.
        KeyError
            If it omits either key.
        ValueError
            If either value is below 1.
