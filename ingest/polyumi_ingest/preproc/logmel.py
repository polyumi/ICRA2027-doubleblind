"""
Log-mel spectrograms for the contact-mic diagnostic, in numpy/scipy alone.

**Nothing trains on the output of this module.** It exists so the catalog and the quality pass
can answer "did the contact mic actually record anything", and so a human can look at an episode
without a GPU box — via ``ingest/integration/visualize_logmel.py`` for a whole episode at once,
or the ``/finger/logmel`` MCAP channel to scrub it against the video and audio in Foxglove.
The spectrogram the *policy* sees is computed inside the training container
from the raw waveform ``--type polyumi`` ships, after waveform-domain augmentation — see
``docs/maniwav-audio-policy.md``. The two are not required to agree bit-for-bit, and this one
must never become an input to training, because a precomputed mel cannot be augmented.

Parameters follow ManiWAV's so the picture resembles what the model will see: 64 HTK mel bins
over a 25 ms frame at a 10 ms hop, natural log of the power spectrum. The filterbank is
triangular and unnormalised, which is the Kaldi/AST convention their ``ASTFeatureExtractor``
uses rather than librosa's area-normalised default.
