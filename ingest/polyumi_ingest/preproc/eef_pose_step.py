    Largest position step between adjacent tracked frames of the SLAM trajectory.

    Returns None if unmeasurable (fewer than two adjacent tracked frames).

    The usability gate's blind spot: an episode can track every frame it was fed, report a
    tracking_ratio of 1.000, and still teleport a metre between two of them when SLAM
    relocalizes against the wrong part of the map. Nothing in the frame counts can see that,
    because no frame was lost — see ``polyumi_ingest.quality``.

    Measured here rather than on ``gopro/slam_poses`` because this is the frame the policy
    consumes and the lever arm amplifies what step 2 cannot see: with
    ``p_hand = p_cam + R_cam · t`` and ``|t|`` = 0.2685 m on the current gripper, an
    orientation-only glitch moves the hand up to 54 cm while the camera position never moves.

    Restricted to the post-chirp fed grid, the same window the frame-count checks use: the
    idle prefix is where the localizer is still relocalizing and never reaches the dataset,
    and the skipped frames have no pose by construction. Pairs spanning a tracking gap are
    excluded — a longer gap legitimately covers more distance, and the lost-frame threshold
    already judges those.

    """
    Re-express each episode's pose trajectory onto the canonical hand frame.

    Neither raw pose source is in a frame the policy can use. OptiTrack reports the pose of the
    marker *rigid body*, whose origin Motive places at the marker centroid — an arbitrary point
    that moves whenever the markers are re-stuck. SLAM reports the GoPro optical frame. Neither
    coincides with the frame the robot reports at inference, and the two are not even in the
    same frame as each other, so models trained from different sources are not comparable.

    Both sources are converted onto one canonical **body** frame — the hand — and written to
    **one array per available source**, ``<episode>/eef/pose_optitrack`` and/or
    ``<episode>/eef/pose_slam``, on the GoPro frame grid (the same grid as ``gopro/frames`` and
    ``annotations/gripper_width``, so a single index serves all three downstream). Writing both
    alternates (rather than baking in a single winner) lets pose-source selection move to
    **export time** — see ``export.dp.buffer`` — instead of being frozen at preprocessing time.
    ``eef.attrs['default_source']`` records which one export uses absent an override.

    The chain routes both sources through the **GoPro frame** and then applies one shared
    ``T_gopro_to_fingertip`` hop::

        slam:      T_s_gp  ──────────────────────────────────► · T_gp_hand
        optitrack: T_o_rb · inv(T_gb_rb) · T_gb_gp  ─────────► · T_gp_hand

    The GoPro is the pivot because it is the only thing both embodiments share. ``gripper_base``
    is a mechanical part of the *handheld* gripper that the Franka end-effector does not have,
    so a frame defined against it could never be reconstructed on the robot; it survives here
    only as an intermediate in the OptiTrack chain, where it is valid because the markers really
    are mounted on that part. The GoPro-to-fingers geometry is identical across both, so a hand
    frame defined against the GoPro is reproducible on either.

    The *world* frame is deliberately left alone: OptiTrack-sourced poses stay in the OptiTrack
    frame and SLAM-sourced poses in the SLAM frame. A shared world frame cancels out of the
    relative pose representation the policy trains on, so normalizing it would be busywork;
    the body frame does not cancel, which is why it has to be fixed here. See
    ``transforms.retarget_body_frame``.

    SLAM's NaN rows are carried through untouched -- both genuine tracking losses and, under
    ``localization_frame_stride``, every frame the localizer was never fed. Nothing here invents
    a pose: gaps become episode boundaries at export (see ``export.dp.buffer``), which is the
    upstream UMI policy and means every exported pose is a real measurement. OptiTrack is dense
    and has no gaps to begin with.

    Runs after step 3 (slam-optitrack-align), which needs the untouched source-frame poses to
    solve for T_ws, and step 4 (aruco-gripper-width), which defines the GoPro-grid convention.

    Prerequisites: ``T_gopro_to_fingertip`` in ``config/gripper_calib.yaml``; ``timestamps/gopro``
    per episode; and either ``optitrack/pose`` + ``optitrack/timestamps`` in the root group or
    ``gopro/slam_poses`` in the episode.
