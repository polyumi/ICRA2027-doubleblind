"""
Per-episode failure records, so one bad episode can't sink a whole scene.

Ingest is a batch pipeline: a scene holds tens of episodes and each preprocessing step walks
all of them. A single damaged session — a zero-byte JPEG left by a killed recorder, a GoPro
file that never finished flushing — used to raise out of the episode loop and abort the
scene, discarding the work already done on every other episode.

Instead, ``build_pzarr`` and the preprocessing-step harness run their per-episode work inside
:func:`episode_guard`, which on failure:

* records it on the episode group (``episode.attrs['failure']``) so later steps skip that
  episode rather than tripping over its half-written arrays, and
* adds the session directory to ``scene.json``'s ``unusable_episodes`` — the marker the
  catalog UI sets by hand and DP export already honours, so the episode drops out of
  datasets with no further work.

Nothing here deletes data: the partial episode group stays on disk for inspection, and a
``--force`` re-run retries it, clearing both marks if it succeeds. Only a mark this module
made is ever cleared — an episode a human marked unusable in the catalog UI has no
``failure`` record, so it stays marked.

The one exception is ``build_pzarr``, which resets every successfully-built session to usable
outright rather than going through :func:`clear_episode_failure`. It has to: it opens the
store ``mode='w'``, so the previous run's ``failure`` attr is gone before the retry-clearing
path could ever see it, and a session that failed once would otherwise stay excluded forever.
Rebuilding is the "start over from the raw sessions" operation, so it discards catalog-UI
curation along with everything else.
