"""
Deriving the closed-gripper ArUco width (the closed width) from a recorded open/close session.

This is PolyUMI's answer to ``scripts/calibrate_gripper_range.py`` in the upstream
``universal_manipulation_interface`` repo, which takes a plain
``np.nanmin`` / ``np.nanmax`` over every frame of a calibration video. That statistic is brittle in
a way that is invisible in its output: two bad PnP solves set the whole range, and a single number
cannot distinguish "the gripper sat closed for 200 frames here" from "one frame reconstructed
badly". Both are just a small float.

So the reduction reports a *shape* instead of a number. A genuine closed plateau shows up two ways:
the low percentiles cluster tightly together, and many samples sit within a millimetre of the
minimum. An outlier shows up as a minimum detached from p1 with a sample count of one or two. The
caller picks from that, and :func:`format_report` renders it for a human to eyeball.

The measurement itself is ingest step 4's (``aruco_step.py``): ``right_tvec.x - left_tvec.x``, the
finger-tag centre separation in metres, depth-gated to detections landing at ``nominal_z``. Feed
this ``raw_widths_m`` — the actual per-frame detections — and never ``width_m``, which has been
resampled onto the GoPro grid with hold-at-edges extrapolation and would drag the extremes toward
whatever the series happened to start and end on.

What the closed width is *for*: it is the tag separation with the fingers touching, which the DP
exporter subtracts so that exported widths are opening-from-closed (UMI's convention), and which
the FR3 side pairs with its own closed aperture. The full procedure is in
docs/calibration-instructions.md; the inference-side units are in polyumi_ros2/gripper_map.py.

#: Percentiles reported alongside the raw min, low to high. The point is to see where the low tail
#: stops moving: if p0.5 through p5 are all within a millimetre, that flat region is the closed
#: plateau. If the minimum sits well below p1, it is an outlier rather than a measurement.
REPORT_PERCENTILES = (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0)

#: Which of the above is taken as the closed width by default. p1 keeps a handful of bad detections out
#: of a number that lands in a robot command, while staying on the plateau for any recording where
#: the gripper is actually shut for a reasonable fraction of the time.
DEFAULT_PERCENTILE = 1.0

#: Half-width of the band counted as "at the plateau". Loose relative to ArUco's real precision on
#: a 16 mm tag, deliberately: the question it answers is "was the gripper parked here", not "how
#: repeatable is the detector".
PLATEAU_TOL_M = 0.001

#: Below this many samples on the plateau, the minimum is probably noise rather than a dwell.
MIN_PLATEAU_SAMPLES = 20

#: ...but a raw count is not enough on its own. A long, slow sweep that never stops at the closed
#: position still drops plenty of samples into the bottom millimetre purely by passing through it —
#: a 2000-sample ramp over an 85 mm span leaves ~24 there, clearing any fixed threshold. So the
#: tally is also compared against the density a *uniform* traversal of the same span would produce,
#: and has to beat it by this factor. That makes the check scale-free: independent of frame rate,
#: recording length, and how many cycles the operator did.
#:
#: 1.5 rather than a rounder number because it is anchored to real data, not taste: on the
#: calibration scene the closed dwell beats the uniform expectation by 2.74x (980 samples against
#: 358), so anything above ~2.5 would reject a recording that is plainly good. It sits far enough
#: below that to leave margin, and far enough above 1.0 to still catch a pure ramp, which by
#: definition scores 1.0.
