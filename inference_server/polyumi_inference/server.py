"""
Server half of the inference protocol: the app every PolyUMI inference server is.

:func:`create_app` owns the HTTP surface -- the three routes, decoding the frame, enforcing the
contract, turning a bad frame into a 422, truncating the chunk, and the request timing. A server is
then only a :class:`PolicyBackend`: a sine oscillator for bringup, a diffusion checkpoint in
production. Neither writes a route.

That split is what makes "the dummy must refuse exactly what a checkpoint refuses" structural
rather than a convention two files have to keep matching by hand.
