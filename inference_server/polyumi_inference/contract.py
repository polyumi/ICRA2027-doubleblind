"""
What the PolyUMI policy requires of an observation.

:mod:`polyumi_inference.wire` decides whether a frame is *readable*. This module decides whether it
is *servable* -- the channels, dimensions and shapes a checkpoint was trained on.

It exists as one function because two servers must agree on it exactly. ``dummy_server`` is the
bringup path: every frame it accepts is one a checkpoint will later be handed, so a frame it accepts
and the real server rejects is a bug discovered on hardware. Both call
:func:`validate_observation`, so that agreement is a shared call rather than two matching listings.

#: The wrist camera, named for the dataset field it comes from.

#: Absolute end-effector pose ``[x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw, gripper]``. A wire concept: the server
#: splits it into three separate ``shape_meta`` fields before the policy sees it.
AGENT_POS_CHANNEL = 'agent_pos'

#: The finger camera, named for the dataset field it comes from.
FINGER_CHANNEL = 'finger_rgb'
#: The contact mic. Alone among the channels this is NOT one entry per observation step: its
#: leading dim is the policy's ``audio_obs_horizon``, a training-time constant that need not equal
#: ``n_obs_steps`` (17 against 2 for the Vista family), because the mic updates far faster than
#: the control loop and the policy consumes a window of rows rather than one row per step.
MIC0_CHANNEL = 'mic_0'
#: Samples in one ``mic_0`` row: 33.5 ms at 16 kHz. Fixed by the dataset's own blocking, so it is
#: the same for every checkpoint, unlike the row count.
MIC0_SAMPLES_PER_ROW = 536

#: Channels the policy cannot run without. Named for the dataset's own fields, so wiring a new
#: modality is adding a name here and in shape_meta rather than reshaping the request.
