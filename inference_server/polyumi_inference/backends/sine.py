"""
A sine-wave backend, so the ROS client can be brought up without a GPU or a checkpoint.

Two channels oscillate, at the same frequency but 90 degrees apart: X on a sine, gripper width on a
cosine. The phase offset is deliberate -- the gripper's extremes land on X's zero crossings, so a
routing bug that feeds X into the gripper (or vice versa) is visible at a glance in the logs and in
Foxglove, instead of looking perfectly plausible.

Because it goes through :func:`polyumi_inference.server.create_app` like the real server, it refuses
exactly what the real server refuses. That matters: this is the bringup path, so a frame it accepts
must be one a checkpoint would also accept.
