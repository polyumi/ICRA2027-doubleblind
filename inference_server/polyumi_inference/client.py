"""
Client half of the inference protocol.

:class:`PolicyClient` is what the ROS-side ``policy_client_node`` holds. It owns the three
endpoints, the URL arithmetic between them, and the persistent connection; it does not own logging
or retry policy, which belong to the caller (the node logs and carries on; a script might want to
die).

Every failure is a :class:`TransportError` rather than a ``None`` return, so a caller cannot
accidentally treat "the server refused this frame" as "no actions this tick" -- and so the server's
own explanation survives into the caller's log.

    How a :class:`PolicyClient` actually speaks HTTP.

    One method, not one per body type. The client makes three different requests -- a binary frame
    to ``/predict_cartesian/``, a JSON document to ``/reset``, and a bodiless ``GET /health`` -- but
    the thing that varies between implementations is the HTTP client, not the encoding. There are
    two implementations: :class:`RequestsTransport` in production, and the in-process one in
    :mod:`polyumi_inference.testing` that lets a real client drive a real app with no socket. That
    second one is the point of this seam; it is not a plugin surface.

    An implementation raises :class:`TransportError` when the request does not complete at all, and
    returns a :class:`Reply` for anything the server answered -- including a 4xx. Deciding what a
    status code means is :class:`PolicyClient`'s job, so both transports agree on it for free.
