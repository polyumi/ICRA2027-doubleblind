"""
The client and the server, tested against each other.

A real :class:`PolicyClient` puts the exact bytes the ROS node puts on the wire, and the exact
server code a checkpoint runs behind decodes them -- in one process, with no socket and no second
interpreter.

Everything here goes through :func:`create_app`, so it holds for *every* backend. That is the point:
``dummy_server`` is the bringup path, so a frame it accepts must be one a checkpoint would also
accept, and the two share the code that decides.
